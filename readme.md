## Go & Graphql

- This repo will be a practice with Go and GraphQL. I will split this repo in three stages.
  Initially I will follow some tutorials and poke around some code to understand how things work in Go with GraphQL.
  The second stage will be a refactoring of a Typescript code that uses GraphQL. I want to practice using an existing code that I have to see what I can learn from there.
  Finally, I will create a project for an Ice Cream and AÃ§aÃ­ store that will use Go + GraphQL + Postgres + gRPC + Reactive Native (or Angular with Ionic idk...)
